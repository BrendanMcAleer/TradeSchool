# TradeSchool

Trade School is an educational platform intended to teach individuals about investing in the stock market. It is still under development.

The platform includes real-time stock data and features such as a practice portfolio of five stocks and a balance of $10,000 paper money to invest.

After creating a profile, users select three different industries to invest in based on their personal interests. Five companies are then displayed from each industry based on the user's selections. The companies available to invest in were picked based on market cap and how recognizable they are.
